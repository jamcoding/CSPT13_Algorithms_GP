Let's come up with a plan for the following problem...
```
We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides into the number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 evenly. 

And we'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly, so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. 

Write a function to determine if a number divides itself.

**Understand**

- should we deal with non numeric values?
- how should we handle decimal values?
- what should this function return? True or False

**Plan**
- loop through the digits in the number
- use % (modulas) to get the rightmost digit
- use / to discard the rightmost
- if dividing by the single digit leaves a remainder, return False
- also if the digit is a zero, return false

- if the loop exits without returning false, then return true
